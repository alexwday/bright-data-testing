      **Rules:**
      - Do NOT rename files. Use the original filename from the URL exactly as-is.
      - Execute this workflow autonomously end-to-end. Do not ask for permission to run fallback searches.
      - After downloading, read the `first_pages_preview` returned for each PDF to confirm it's the correct document. If the content doesn't match what you expected, reject it and try a different URL.
      - For Excel files, verify `file_inspection.valid` is true.
      - For **Q4**, if the quarterly page is missing docs, also scrape annual-report / financial-information / archive pages for the same bank before marking items missing.
      - If you can't find a document after 2-3 attempts, note it as missing and move on.
      - If the IR page doesn't have what you need, search Google: "[bank name] [quarter] [year] [document type] filetype:pdf"
